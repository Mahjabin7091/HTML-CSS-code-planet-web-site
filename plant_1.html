       <p>&nbsp;It grows to a manageable height of approximately 2-4 ft which is suitable for any room, although it grows at a slow pace. A grower needs to be patient with this one!
        </p>
        <p> <b>Easy to grow:</b> Parlor palm tree's are quite an easy plant to grow and care for, which makes them suitable for those new to growing indoors. They tolerate low light and 
		      colder conditions pretty well. They also don’t need a great amount of feeding or watering.

            <b>Fronds (leaves):</b> The fronds on this palm grow and kind of droop or arch over from the stems once its matured, although it takes quite a bit of time for them to develop.

            <b>Flowers:</b> Some will sprout yellow flowers after a few years of growth and produce seeds, however, the seeds are not likely to grow future plants.

            <b>Growth rate:</b> These do take time to grow to a full size plant, as mentioned above. The amount of time may depend on its light conditions. They all need a few years regardless of conditions.

	   <h1>Parlor Palm Plant Care</h1>
	   <p>  <b> Temperature:</b> Average warmth 65°F (18°C) and above is fine and no less than 50°F (10°C) at night. </p>
	   <p>  <b> watering:</b>Watering the parlor palm too much will cause growing problems and could possibly kill it off. My plant is now fully grown and has enjoyed just a small amount of watering once the soil starts to dry. Very little is needed in the winter. Making sure the roots have good drainage is something they like. </p>
